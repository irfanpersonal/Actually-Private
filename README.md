1st - Download the project

2nd - Run the following command "npm install" (install dependencies)

3rd - Create a .env file in root with the following key value pairs MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, and JWT_LIFETIME

Note: Unlike our previous projects, where we utilized the Cloudinary API for saving images to the cloud, this project will store them directly on the server. To implement this, create a folder named "images" in the root directory.

4th - Type the following command "npm run start" to start application

DONE
